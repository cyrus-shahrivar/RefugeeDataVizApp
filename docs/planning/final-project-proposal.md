# Project Proposal - Refugee Data Visualizer

### What is the project?

A data visualization tool that will allow the user to see refugee resettlement statistics and distribition for the recent past for which there is government data.  The project will, at a minimum, focus on Syrian refugee resettlement in the United States.  It will include an interactive map, a side panel with refugee relevant statistics and news articles, and other data analysis features that will help guide future policy and business decisions that involve refugee resetttlement.

Other features that I plan to use include:
- utilize d3.js as a visualization tool
- scraper tool to get articles relevant to refugees
 - ex. npm cheerio/scrapper
- utilize sentiment tool to analyze articles for positive, negative, neutral sentiment
 - ex. npm sentiment(https://www.npmjs.com/package/sentiment)

### Why am I implementing the project? Why is it an improvement over existing sources/applications?
Currently refugee resettlement data is locked up in government spreadsheets or static graphics.  Refugee resettlement agencies are currently in the process of making major business decisions with the increase in resettlement numbers proposed over the next few years by the federal government.  A tool that helps that process and is transparent will be helpful for those users.
