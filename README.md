### Technologies Used and Installation Instructions
- D3.js: data visualization library
- NodeJS and Express: server
- HTML/CSS/SVGs: front end development

Please install NodeJS and Express globally on your machine prior to continuing.

If you are not forking or cloning, to do a similar project you will also need to link to the D3.js and topojson libraries in your HTML file.  I recommend also including Underscore.js to simplify your functions.

Finally, to deploy I used Heroku's NodeJS deployment instructions and hosted on Heroku.

### General approach

NOTE: Puerto Rico and other US territories not included in this data visualization.
