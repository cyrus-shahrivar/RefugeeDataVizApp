# Project Proposal - Refugee Data Visualizer

A data visualization website that displays:
- refugee resettlement within the United States for the recent past for which there is government data
- specific focus on Syrian refugee crisis at a minimum, but probably will extend for all resettled groups
- utilize d3.js as a visualization tool
- scraper tool to get articles relevant to refugees
 - ex. npm cheerio/scrapper
- utilize sentiment tool to analyze articles for positive, negative, neutral sentiment
 - ex. npm sentiment(https://www.npmjs.com/package/sentiment)
